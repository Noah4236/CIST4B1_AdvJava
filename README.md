# CIST4B1_AdvJava
A repository to document my Java learning journey

About Me:
My name is Noah. 

Goals for This Course:
I want to get a better understanding of the coding process in general, but I also want to get better understanding of more specific things related to syntax and formatting. For example, I learned recently that there can only be one public class in a file. I want to gain a better understanding of things like that, because even if I am able to read and write code well, specific issues like that still trip me up. And of course, I want to build on the knowledge I already have from the advanced topics in this course.
